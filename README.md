# Live-stream-utility

This portable utilty provides a user interface which sshs into a device with a given ip and plays, using vlc, the media link given. It it labeled as livestreaming as this was its original use case however any media link compatible with vlc should work.

I chose to make it portable as the whole reason for this existing is to make ssh as accesible as possible for less tech literate users to get on with so a single .exe file is better than a whole installer even if it is significantly slower to open this way.

Note: you must install vlc yourself on the target device.
